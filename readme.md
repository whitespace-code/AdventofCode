### <font color='blue'>What is Advent of Code</font>
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

This is a compilation of my solutions to the various problems posted in 2022

All the source data files required to solve the problems including the sample data are stored within then <font color='blue'>/Source Files</font> folder for the respective year.

All solutions coded in Jupyter notebooks and converted to .py files
