### <font color='blue'>What is Advent of Code</font>
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles created by Eric Wastl for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some problem solving skills will get you pretty far. Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.

### <font color='blue'>About this project</font>
This is a compilation of my solutions to each daily challenge. I am starting with 2022 as this was the year it was introduced to me but will continue back until conception and into the future as part of the annual challenge over christmas

All the source data files required to solve the problems including the sample data are stored within the <font color='blue'>/Source Files</font> folder for the respective year.

All solutions coded in Jupyter notebooks will also be converted to pure .py files.

All information about each individual challenge will be documented on the notebook, but not on the python scripts

### <font color='blue'>Project folder structure</font>
Below is how the files for this project are arrange and where to find information. Each annual project includes a readme file as well as the code in Jupyter notebook with and .py files.
